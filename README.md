# symmetric-encryption-
this project it to teach you Symmetric Encryption (copy the code to your kali linux and use git clone {the code} to clone it).
In this project,you will learn how to generate a key (use the command cd symmetric-encrption- to enter the directory).
you will learn how to encrypt using symmetric key(enter the command cd symmetric to enter another directory where you will see a text file)
you will learn how decrypt with the same key.(enter the command cat to view the text file for better understanding).
I added a little activity for whoever is reading this.
I generated a key and used the key to encrypt a file,
so after learning kindly decrypt the encrypted file.
This is just to show that you understand it.
